We’ll have everyone from junior-level product analysts to executive-level product professionals, from industries ranging from digital to durables, consumer goods to manufacturing. Based on early interest and projections from ProductCamp events in other cities, we are anticipating 50+ attendees for the first event.</p>

				<h3>Why sponsor?</h3>

The attendees include Product Managers, Product Marketers, VP/Dir of Product Manager/Marketers, Business Development, Students, Entrepreneurs and Job Seekers. This audience represents the most innovative & progressive thought leaders in the product development community – the very people you’re trying to reach.</p>

				<h3>Who typically sponsors?</h3>
